# So-Chat-Commander
Chat Commander is a client side Chrome extension that integrates commands for your use on any Stackexchange Chat.  

So far there are these commands here

- `/collapse`
- `/uncollapse`
- `/giphy <Phrase/Word>`
- `/shruggie`
- `/replyLast <username> <message>` 
- `/cat`
- `/ignore <usernames...> [minutes]`
- `/unignore <usernames...>`

So collapse and uncollapse are self-explanatory, they take any onebox chat message (Wikipedia, SO Question/Answer,  Youtube, Image, etc.) and collapse it

/giphy will send a Gifs to the chat according to anything you send after it.

/shruggie will send a ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

/replyLast will reply to the last message  <username> sent with the message <message>.

/cat will post a random cat picture
