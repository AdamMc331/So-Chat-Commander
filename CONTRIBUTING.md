# Contributing

## Steps
1. Fork this repo.
2. Make your changes.
3. Push to your fork.
4. Test your changes ([see this](#HowToTest)) and make sure to respect the [coding styles](#CodingStyles)
4. Before doing a *pull request*, make sure to be up to date with this repo (`git pull <ORIGINAL_REPO> master`)
5. Do a pull request through **GitHub**.

## Good Habits
When pushing to your fork, make sure to commit as tight around a single goal. If your PR is one big commit, chances are the PR will take more time to verify and will have lower probability of being accepted. It is better to have 5 simple and expressive commits than 1 big loose one!

When creating your PR, explain in details what your goal is. You can explain your thought process, reference existing issues, include a video or GIF to demonstrate, etc.

## How to test?
In order to test your changes, go into `chrome://extensions`, load your local package, and head to `https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/1`. This page is a sandbox made to test, so don't worry about spamming.
